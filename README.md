This package is a fork of [`react-scripts`](https://npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) that adds a
couple more features to [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) tooling:

- Ability to add, build, and test server-side code using the same instance of Webpack.
- Ability to customize Babel, Webpack and other configs.
